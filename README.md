# ToDos

Various implementations of a ToDo application using different tech stacks.

## Why?

I like to explore different libraries and frameworks. I want to see how each of them approached their
implementation for creating a web application to compare and contrast.

A ToDo application is a great way to determine that. Creating one improves one's understanding of a library or framework.
This application requires all the CRUD functionality to be implemented and also allows one to do it through RESTful API calls.

I also think this would help solidify my understanding of frontend and backend framework concepts.
